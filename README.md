Modbus Open Source Simulator is a flexible and lightweight Python-based simulator designed for engineers and developers working with industrial automation systems. It emulates Modbus slave devices (RTU and TCP) to generate realistic process signals, allowing you to test SCADA systems, PLCs, and data acquisition software without physical hardware.
